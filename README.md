Problem Description:

Imagine a small furniture manufacturing unit that produces two types of products: tables and chairs. Each product requires specific quantities of wood and labor to produce, and each contributes differently to the company’s profit. However, the company does not have unlimited resources. There is a finite amount of raw material (wood) and limited working hours (labor) available within a production cycle.

The central question the business faces is:

"How many tables and chairs should we produce to achieve the highest possible profit without exceeding our resource limits?"

Solving this kind of problem manually can be complex and error-prone, especially when the number of products and constraints increase. This is where Operations Research and Linear Programming come into play.

Problem Statement
The company has:
240 units of wood
100 hours of labor

Each table:
Requires 4 units of wood
Requires 2 hours of labor
Provides ₹70 in profit

Each chair:
Requires 3 units of wood
Requires 1 hour of labor
Provides ₹50 in profit

The goal is to decide how many tables (x) and chairs (y) to produce to maximize the total profit, without exceeding the available wood and labor.

Implementation Using Python and PuLP
To solve the problem, we used PuLP, a Python library for Linear Programming. The implementation involved the following steps:

Importing PuLP and creating a problem object
Defining decision variables
Adding the objective function and constraints
Solving the problem and retrieving the results
Here’s a summary of the results generated by the model:

Solution:
Optimal Status: Optimal

Tables to Produce: 30

Chairs to Produce: 40

Maximum Profit: ₹4100

This means the most profitable production plan is to manufacture 30 tables and 40 chairs using the available resources fully without any wastage or overuse.

Insights and Analysis
Let’s explore what these results imply:

Efficient Resource Utilization
All available 240 units of wood and 100 hours of labor are used.
There is no leftover material or under-utilized labor.

Profit Maximization
If the company follows this plan, it will achieve the maximum possible profit of ₹4100 for the current resource levels.
Any deviation (producing more of one product and less of another) would result in lower profit.

Scalable Model
If the company gets more resources (e.g., buys more wood or hires more labor), the same model can be re-run with new values.
Similarly, if costs, profits, or requirements change, they can simply update the input parameters.

Conclusion
This problem showcases how Linear Programming can be a powerful tool in solving real-world business problems. By accurately modeling resource constraints and profit contributions, businesses can make data-driven decisions that improve their operational efficiency and bottom line.
